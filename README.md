🧠 State Management Approach
We used React hooks (useState, useEffect) for lightweight and efficient state management.

🔧 State Structure
Global Entry State:


const [entries, setEntries] = useState([]);
Stored as an array of objects:

[
  {
    id: uuid(),
    title: "Case Name",
    date: "2025-07-20",
    description: "Case details here",
    ...
  }
]
Local Storage Sync:

On initial load, we hydrate entries from localStorage.

Every state update persists to localStorage for persistence across sessions.

🧩 Component Structure
 - `src/`  
  ├── `components/`  
  │   ├── `EntryForm.jsx` – Form to create a new diary entry  
  │   ├── `EntryList.jsx` – Renders the sorted list of entries  
  │   ├── `EntryCard.jsx` – Individual card view with animation  
  │   └── `Header.jsx` – App branding and navigation  
  ├── `utils/`  
  │   └── `storage.js` – Local storage helpers  
  ├── `App.jsx` – Root component with state logic  
  └── `main.jsx` – Entry point


🧩 Insertion Logic (Chronological Ordering)
Every new entry is pushed to the entries array.

The list is immediately sorted in ascending chronological order by date:


const sortedEntries = [...entries].sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date));
This ensures new entries are always placed appropriately in the timeline, not just at the end.

🎞️ Animation Techniques
We use Framer Motion to animate entry cards during:

Mounting (fade/slide-in):


<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
>
  ...
</motion.div>
Removal (fade-out):
Animated exit using AnimatePresence.

This gives the app a modern, dynamic feel, especially as entries are added/removed.

📚 Future Improvements
Drag-and-drop reordering

Search/filter by case title or date

Backend sync with Firebase or Supabase
